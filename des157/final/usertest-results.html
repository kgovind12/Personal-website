        <h2>Observation 1: The card flip animation is successful</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my testing, I observed that users responded well to the cards flipping as they were 
            clicked. This animation engaged them and made the game more realistic, as though they were flipping 
            an actual face-down card to reveal the other side. Additionally, the shadow appearing on the bottom 
            of the card was effective as it preserved its position even as the card was flipped. Overall, the 
            visual feedback made it easy for users to understand the actions that they performed on the page, 
            adding to the positive game experience. Users also admitted that it made them more enthusiastic 
            about interacting with the game.

        <h2>Observation 2: Instructions are unclear</h2>
        <p>
            Through my testing, the first major pain point I observed was that the instructions for the memory 
            game were slightly unclear. In a regular memory game, players are required to match cards that 
            contain the exact same content on the front side. Following the norm, all of the users I tested 
            with expected to find the same text on both cards, so it took them a little while to understand 
            that the content of the matching cards were different. In my game, users are supposed to match 
            one card with a mathematical concept and the other with a formula related to that concept. To 
            eliminate the ambiguity, I realized that instructions about the kind of matches to find would be 
            beneficial. Providing an example of a correct match would also help users know exactly what to expect. 
        </p>

        <h2>Observation 3: The response after a match is found could be more engaging</h2>
        <p>
            When a match is found, the corresponding cards disappear from the window, indicating that they have 
            been collected. The text on the bottom left also changes to show the total number of matches found. 
            Although this is good feedback, it lacks the positive reinforcement that students often require when 
            they attempt to learn a difficult concept. While testing, I found out that my users often waited for 
            an additional response after finding a match. To add to the engagement, it would help to add a sound 
            effect or an animation as the cards disappear. Other sound effects when the user wins the game or 
            when the timer is up, could also provide valuable auditory feedback to keep users engaged.
        </p>

        <h2>Observation 4: It’s slightly difficult to keep track of the matches found and time remaining while playing the game</h2>
        <p>
            One of the users I tested with mentioned that they were so engrossed in the game that they did not 
            look toward the bottom of the page much. Therefore, they found that they weren’t paying very close 
            attention to the time remaining and number of matches found as they played the game. Only at the 
            start and end of the game did they happen to notice the text at the bottom. One of the users 
            mentioned that I could increase the size or color of this text so that their attention is drawn to 
            it. To help users keep track of these variables while the game is in progress, I realized I could 
            find a better placement for this text that isn’t too far from the user’s focus as they play the 
            game. Maybe moving it to the top, right above the cards, would ensure that it is always in the 
            user’s line of sight.
        </p>

        <h2>Observation 5: Users lose some time in reading instructions</h2>
        <p>
            Since the timer starts as soon as the page loads, users lose a few seconds as they read the 
            instructions. This leaves them with less time to complete the game. When asking about ways to 
            improve this aspect, I received two suggestions. One is to have an overlay introducing the game 
            and the instructions before transitioning into the main screen when the user is ready. A second 
            option is to keep a start button on the left column underneath the instructions, that allows the 
            user to start the timer after they have acquainted themselves with the rules. With this option, 
            the cards would have to be disabled until the timer is started, so that they cannot be opened beforehand. 
        </p>

        <h2>Future Iterations:</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the feedback I received, I plan to make the following changes: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Changing the placement of the text representing the game variables to better fit the user’s line of vision.</li>
                <li>Adding sounds to the game to enhance the engagement and provide auditory feedback.</li>
                <li>Adding more instructions along with examples about what the user is expected to match.</li>
                <li>Adding a start button in addition to the reset button that the user can click to start the timer when they are ready.</li>
            </ol>
            I believe that these modifications would improve user cognition and involvement, and provide a better understanding of the game’s purpose related to students.
