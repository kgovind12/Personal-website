        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>My project, Geomemory, is an online memory card game with geometric formulae instead of pictures.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.improvememory.org/wp-content/games/magic-cards/index.html">Magic Cards</a> is a similar 
            memory game that allows users to match cards from a classic card deck. Its background image, though minimalistic, 
            gives a mysterious feel that complements the game’s name. The background also contains moving white specks that 
            engage users visually, but also do not distract from the main content. The cards are arranged in a grid spanning 
            the width of the whole page, giving users enough space to distinguish and interact with each card. The game also 
            provides user feedback in the form of sound effects when a card is opened or a match is found. To improve the 
            design, I believe the typeface used in the header to display the time remaining could be made decorative to match 
            the style of the page. But overall, this game applies usability principles such as familiarity, white space, and 
            feedback, making it an effective game experience. 
        </p>
    
        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://toytheater.com/math-flash-cards/">Math Flashcards</a> is a game meant for primary school students 
            to learn simple addition, multiplication, subtraction and division. It provides the user with a question and allows 
            them to select the answer from a list of options. This game shares my idea of teaching math through interaction. 
            The illustrations and animations used in this game are very kid-friendly and also maintain a central color theme. 
            I particularly liked the use of a clinking sound effect to indicate when a question has been answered correctly. 
            This positive feedback provides a pleasing emotional experience for young students as well as validation for their 
            efforts. If I were learning primary school math, I would definitely frequent this site for extra practice.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>
            My project will be an iteration of the ‘Game On’ project I completed for the third studio. With my newfound 
            knowledge of objects as ways to store data, I hope to build on these game development concepts to reinforce 
            interactive learning. Education is an area I am passionate about, and I want to make learning easier for visual 
            and tactile learners like me. Moreover, many college students are often frustrated with the rote learning of 
            concepts, so I want to make it more hands-on. My idea for this project is to have a set of cards containing 
            geometry formulae that students can match. Rather than having exactly matching pairs, one card will contain the 
            name of a concept, (such as ‘Area of a triangle’) and another card will contain the matching formula 
            (such as ‘½*b*h’). This way, students can remember formulae by interacting with each card as they would in a 
            regular memory game. Through this project, I aim to improve students’ retention of math concepts, decrease 
            their frustration with math, and bring out a new interest in learning.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            For the layout, I will have a column on the left with the game title, description, instructions, and current 
            player scores. The main content will contain a set of cards that the user can interact with, arranged in a grid 
            to give a sense of balance. By applying the Gestalt principles of Grouping and Proximity to separate the 
            informational elements from the interactive ones, I will be able to avoid a potential cognitive overload. 
            In terms of the color scheme, I will have mostly soft blues and greens. The left column will have a light 
            background color, while the cards will have slightly darker colors for emphasis towards them. Through my 
            research, I’ve found that blue has a calming effect on users, while green is commonly associated with progress 
            and success. I believe these two colors combined will give users the right amount of reassurance and motivation 
            as they go through the game. For the typeface, I’ve found ‘Overpass’ to be a web-friendly, easy to read font 
            that resonates well with multiple age groups. 
        </p>
    
        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            Since movement is often an important part of the game experience, I think users should see movement happening 
            before they start the game. I plan to have the word ‘Start’ fade in and out of the screen to signal that the 
            user may begin to interact with the cards. I am considering the use of a timer, since this often helps me keep 
            pace with my own work. This might be useful for users who have trouble staying focused. It would also be helpful 
            to give users an option to select the amount of time they want on the timer, since every student studies at their 
            own pace. When a user clicks on a card, it will flip to reveal the formula or concept that is on the other side. 
            I also plan to have a quick card flipping sound effect indicating that a card has been opened. If the user finishes 
            finding all the matches before the time is up, I will display some text on the screen with positive feedback, such 
            as ‘Great job, you found all the matches!’ This will be accompanied by an upbeat soundtrack to bring out a positive 
            emotional response in the user. As a final iteration, I also want to make it possible for two players to play and 
            keep their own individual scores, since many students benefit from learning with their peers.
        </p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I intend for this experience to be enjoyable and visually engaging. My primary goal is to change our collective 
            outlook on learning, since many view their classes and homework with resentment. Through this game, I aim to not 
            only make it easier for students to pick up on concepts, but also make learning seem like a fun activity rather 
            than a chore. I will keep the cards aligned in a grid of not more than 16 cards, since I want to improve 
            cognition and reduce distraction. Students often feel overwhelmed with all the information they are required to 
            remember, so presenting information little by little using visual elements will definitely help in making the 
            experience clear and manageable. For students who are interesting in gaming or have a knack for solving puzzles, 
            this game will be intellectually stimulating. Above all, I hope to motivate everyone to revisit their classes 
            with a positive perspective. In the future, I hope to expand this project to cover multiple subjects.
